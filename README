Fleegix.js JavaScript Toolkit
------------------------------------------------------------
http://js.fleeix.org/

Intro
------------------------

Fleegix.js is a JavaScript toolkit that provides a lightweight,
cross-browser set of tools for building dynamic JavaScript
UIs for Web applications.

Getting started
------------------------

Using Fleegix.js in your applications is easy. Download a
release and include the code in your Web page with a JavaScript
<script> tag.

In development, you may want to use the uncompressed version
to make debugging easy. In that case, you'd use a script block
like this:

<script type="text/javascript"
    src="/fleegix.js.uncompressed.js">

In a production environment, you'll likely want to use the
compressed version of the file to make downloads faster. The
script block for that would look like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/fleegix.js">

The file is compressed with the YUI Compressor
(http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/).

You can also use the pieces of the library separately. The
individual pieces are in the /src directory of the release. To
use just the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) library, you'd do a script
tag like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/xhr.js">

All of the paths in these script tags assume you are placing
the file at the root of your Web server.

Plugins
------------------------
There are also plugins for Fleegix.js which extend its
functionality, and can also be used standalone with other
JavaScript toolkits.

These plugins can be found in the /plugins directory of the
Fleegix.js Subversion repository. There is also some plugin
documentation available at http://js.fleegix.org/plugins.

Compatibility
------------------------

Fleegix.js works on all modern, mainstream browsers. It is
known to work on the following:

  * Mozilla 1.5+, Firefox 1.0+
  * Internet Explorer 6+
  * Safari 2+

It is likely to work on other standards-conformant browsers
(e.g., Opera, OmniWeb), but has not been tested with these.

Documentation
------------------------

Extensive API documentation can be found in docs/index.html,
or in plaintext format in docs/index.txt.
